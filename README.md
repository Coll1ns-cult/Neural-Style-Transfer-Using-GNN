# Neural-Style-Transfer-Using-GNN

Replication of Learning Graph Neural Networks for Image Style Transfer (https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11681)


Note: Paper has no implementation.
#Changes
Made
 - GATv2 instead of GAT, as graph in the network is bipartite graph in which dynamic attention is proved to be effective instead of static attention
 Planning
 - Implementing other types of graph construction to experiment which suits best for the problem. For example, using Threshold instead of KNN and etc
 
 
 #To Do
 - Implementing Deformable Patch for style graph node construction.

#Results
Soon
#Theoritical work
Soon
